# node-nessie
A partial ORM for oracledb

This is not intended to be a finished project for release. I'm writing exactly what I need for a current personal project, and at the time of writing this, I do not intend to maintain this.

Based on [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)

## Features
- 

## Not Yet Implemented
I'm sure there's more that could be implemented at some point, but this is what I personally think should be implemented before 1.0
- an underlying separate sql builder module rather than template literal queries
- model template generation for QOL
- native migrations/seeders support
- internal value sanitization
- stricter attribute validation (especially for bulkCreate)
- potential for bulkCreate to pull default values to fill missing attributes in query
- joins in select queries
- transactions

## Contributing
If you feel like contributing, there's a very high chance you should just maintain a fork instead.

You're welcome to open PRs, but no promises

## Nessie?
Listen, I'm not good at naming things, so here was my thought process:
- oracle
- greek mythological oracles
- the very obvious oracle at delphi (aka Pythia)
- "Her title was also historically glossed in English as the Pythoness" -[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia#:~:text=Her%20title%20was%20also%20historically%20glossed%20in%20English%20as%20the%20Pythoness)
- I want to call this something related to "snek" after a nickname given to my friend
- "snek" seems taken by a lot of other things, and I can't go with python because that's *very* taken
- w/e we're going with nessie even if it would be impossible to trace nessie back to pythoness without explanation
- and the loch ness monster is supposed to be reptilian anyways right
